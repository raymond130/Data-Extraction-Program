# Data-Extraction-Program
Program that extracts ordered lists of data from larger ordered files.


The purpose of this program is to take a list of data, ordered by some parameter, e.g. a list of names and addresses and put them into individually ordered vectors, in order to make the data easier to extract, manipulate, and work with.
